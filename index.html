        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a college freshman majoring in Computer Engineering, I bring proficiency in C, and Java, with a focus on DSA and competitive programming demonstrated through active participation on Leetcode and Hackerrank. While I have exposure to front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Bootstrap Framework, my primary strength lies in algorithmic problem-solving and also Android development based on Flutter. Eager to learn and contribute to innovative projects, I'm open to connecting with fellow students and professionals in the tech industry.
            I also have an interest in photography and cinematography as my leisure time hobby. Working on my graphics and animation skills to enhance the overall structure creation through Blender and Autocad.</p>
